## Overview
There are several tools packged with uvProject. Some generate (project) UVs, some modify existing UVs and some operate on related attributes.

Most tools have both modifier and edit mesh tool variants.

## Quick Start
A good way to dive right in is adding a "UV Island Unwrap" modifier to a cube, apply a grid texture and start modelling.

!!! note "If you are using the "Checker Texture" shader node, make sure you feed in the UV map to the vector input"
